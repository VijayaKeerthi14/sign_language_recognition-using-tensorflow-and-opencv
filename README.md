### Sign Language Recognition

This project focuses on developing a robust **Sign Language Recognition System** that utilizes computer vision and deep learning to interpret hand gestures. The model is trained to detect and classify various sign language symbols using a dataset of images, enabling real-time recognition through live camera input.  

#### Key Features:
- **Dataset**: custom-collected datasets.  
- **Model**: Built using TensorFlow/Keras with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for high accuracy in gesture classification.  
- **Live Recognition**: Integrates with a live camera feed to display real-time predictions and spoken outputs.  

#### Technology Stack:
- **Libraries**: TensorFlow, OpenCV, MediaPipe, cvzone.  
- **Programming Language**: Python.
